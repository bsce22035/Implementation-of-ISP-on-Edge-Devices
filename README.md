## 📖 Project Overview

This repository contains the source code, custom hardware designs, and comprehensive benchmarking suites for deploying advanced **Image Signal Processors (ISPs)** onto resource-constrained edge devices. 

Our research systematically evaluates the strict technical trade-offs between execution speed, hardware power constraints, and visual image quality. We bridge the gap between high-level Python AI training and pure silicon hardware design, comparing Classical (rule-based) ISPs against Learned (Neural Network-driven) ISPs.

## 🚀 Key Achievements

- **Real-Time AI Processing:** Successfully translated Python-based neural ISPs into highly optimized CUDA C, achieving up to **527 FPS** on an NVIDIA Quadro GPU.
- **Hardware-Level Execution:** Engineered a custom FPGA datapath architecture (Nexys-4 Artix-7) to execute Neural ISPs without standard memory bottlenecks.
- **Zero-Shot Domain Adaptation:** Built a mathematical pipeline to adapt a Mediatek-trained AI model to process raw 14-bit data from a **Google Pixel 7a** smartphone with zero network retraining, achieving **16.32 dB PSNR**.

## 🏛️ Repository Architecture & Project Pillars

This project is divided into four major technical domains. Please navigate to the respective folders for source code, deployment instructions, and detailed metric logs.

### 1. [Edge Hardware Benchmarking](./Benchmarking)
We deployed and benchmarked four different ISPs (FastOpenISP, InfiniteISP, SYENet, and SlimEYE) across multiple edge platforms.
* **Hardware Evaluated:** Raspberry Pi 3, Raspberry Pi 5, Intel Neural Compute Stick 2 (NCS2).
* **Metrics Analyzed:** Precise latency (FPS) vs visual reconstruction quality (PSNR/SSIM).

### 2. High-Performance CUDA GPU Acceleration
To address the heavy computational overhead of neural ISPs, we manually translated the lightweight SYENet-Slim architecture from Python into highly optimized **CUDA C**.
* **Deployment:** Natively running on an NVIDIA Quadro T1000 GPU (896 CUDA cores).
* **Performance:** Massive acceleration (527 FPS) while maintaining pristine image quality (24.85 dB PSNR).

### 3. Custom FPGA Hardware Design
We engineered a custom hardware architecture for the SYENet Slim pipeline designed to operate within strict embedded constraints.
* **Device:** Nexys-4 / XC7A100T (Artix-7 FPGA).
* **Datapath:** FSM-driven logic executing one INT8 MAC per clock cycle via a single DSP48E1 unit.

### 4. [Cross-Sensor Domain Adaptation](./Cross%20Sensor%20Testing)
AI models are typically highly sensor-specific. We proved the generalizability of SYENet by capturing a proprietary, real-world raw dataset using a **Google Pixel 7a** smartphone.
* **The Challenge:** Pixel 7a uses a 14-bit depth and 0 black-level, whereas the model expects 12-bit depth and a 344 black-level.
* **The Solution:** We engineered a mathematical zero-shot preprocessing pipeline (bit-scaling, black-level injection, and color nudges) to seamlessly translate the foreign hardware physics into the model's native profile.
